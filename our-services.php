                    <p id="first">Veneers and crowns are thin shells of porcelain that fit precisely over the front
                        surfaces of your teeth to restore damage and improve esthetics. The veneers can also mask
                        surface stains while letting light through to appear entirely natural. They are affixed with an
                        adhesive to the front surfaces of the teeth. Porcelain veneers are extremely durable and allow
                        you to function as usual.

                        correct defects caused by surgery and to assist those with respiratory problems.
